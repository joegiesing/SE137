            <p> I was born on November 12, 2000 in New London, Connecticut, and I grew up in North Stonington, Connecticut. When I has young I enjoyed playing with legos and playing Mario and Duck Hunter on the NES, which was my introduction to video games. Once i started going to school I began playing rec league sports, like baseball, basketball, and soccer, until I got bored of them around middle shool. Around this time I got an xbox 360 and started playing games again more and I was hooked. This eventually led to me becoming interested with code and learning a little bit early on, which led me to the career path that I chose.

            Eventually I got to highschool and joined the school cross country team, history club, and other activities. During this time I stopped coding until senior year when I had a computer science class where we learned python. It was my first time using python but it reminded me of how much I enjoyed messing with code and seeing how things worked on the back end. At the time I was unsure of what I wanted to do for my future career and education, but that class put me on the path to New England Tech. Today I am working toward my bachelors degree in software engineering.
